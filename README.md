This is a project for my data science class, csci 183. This project intends to utilize machine learning algorithms to predict the duration, calories burnt, and difficulty based on the trail's path, most often represented by a .gpx file. I chose quadratic regression and KNN as my algorithms of choice. A report on the project can be found in the main branch.

For the .gpx collection dataset, please access it at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roccoli/gpx-hike-tracks and drag it into the /data folder to run the code, as the file itself is too big for github. # hiking
